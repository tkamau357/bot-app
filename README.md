# Bot Battle
#### For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a galactic web app that will allow them to browse through a list of robots, view a robot's details, and, enlist a bot into their army., 24/04/23
#### By **John Thairu Kamau**

## Description
Create a react application that can display profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`. Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**. The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`. Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the `YourBotArmy` component. Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.
